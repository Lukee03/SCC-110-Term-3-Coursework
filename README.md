Welcome to Spacewar!
This is a 2 player game where your goal is to eliminate the other player.
A few points before you begin:
- Controls are listed on the splash screen before entering the game
- Each ship is represented by 2 "*" while the black hole is the flickering line in the center. You can see which direction you're facing in based on where the second asterisk is pointing towards
- The other ship can collide with you, be shot at or fall into the black hole to lose.
- Score is listed at the top of the screen, as well as how much fuel you have for moving and how many bullets you have remaining
Have fun!
